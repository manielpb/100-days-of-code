# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 24, Wednesday
**Started with freecodecamps Responsive Web Design Certification, I used HTML in building a cat app
**Thoughts** It was really difficult and everything was just new to me i spent 3 hours on it
**Links to work**currently i dont know how to get the link to here also i tried pushing the code to github but everything just seems dificult for me at the moment, one thing i learnt today was 'charset-uts 8'

### Day 2: May 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed Freecodecamps Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu,it took me about 2hours to complete,I was just following the instructions without good knowledge of what i was doing but normally i google what i don't really understand,some of the things i learnt today was meta elements,pseudo-selector and css selectors.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent

###Day 3: May 26, Friday
**Today's Progress:Still on freecodecamps web design certification and today it was about  CSS Set of colored markers, I learnt how colors are represented in css from just specifying the color to using rgb to using hexadecimal to hsl to linear gradient for fine tuning them colors.

**Thoughts Now html and css are starting to get familiar for me i understand how somethings are and some codes are now at my fingertips.ps i want to go and buy bread and egg rn which is 1:39 am and watch the popes exorcist,wish me luck

**Day4: May 28, Sunday
**Today's Progress:Built a registration form using html and css.Writing the code now is becoming off the head activity 

**Day 5:June 7,wednesday
Its been more than a week since i updated the log problem being i got the survey certification part in freecodecamp and being the first task which i dont get short tasks i was quite stuck but i finally completed the tasks today and i hope i dont ever do that again.ps coding is hard and difficult but i promise i'll make it easy for me
