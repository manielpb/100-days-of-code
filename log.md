# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 24, Wednesday
**Started with freecodecamps Responsive Web Design Certification, I used HTML in building a cat app
**Thoughts** It was really difficult and everything was just new to me i spent 3 hours on it
**Links to work**currently i dont know how to get the link to here also i tried pushing the code to github but everything just seems dificult for me at the moment, one thing i learnt today was 'charset-uts 8'

### Day 2: May 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed Freecodecamps Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu,it took me about 2hours to complete,I was just following the instructions without good knowledge of what i was doing but normally i google what i don't really understand,some of the things i learnt today was meta elements,pseudo-selector and css selectors.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent
