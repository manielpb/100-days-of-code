# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 24, Wednesday
**Started with freecodecamps Responsive Web Design Certification, I used HTML in building a cat app
**Thoughts** It was really difficult and everything was just new to me i spent 3 hours on it
**Links to work**currently i dont know how to get the link to here also i tried pushing the code to github but everything just seems dificult for me at the moment, one thing i learnt today was 'charset-uts 8'

### Day 2: May 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed Freecodecamps Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu,it took me about 2hours to complete,I was just following the instructions without good knowledge of what i was doing but normally i google what i don't really understand,some of the things i learnt today was meta elements,pseudo-selector and css selectors.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent

###Day 3: May 26, Friday
**Today's Progress:Still on freecodecamps web design certification and today it was about  CSS Set of colored markers, I learnt how colors are represented in css from just specifying the color to using rgb to using hexadecimal to hsl to linear gradient for fine tuning them colors.

**Thoughts Now html and css are starting to get familiar for me i understand how somethings are and some codes are now at my fingertips.ps i want to go and buy bread and egg rn which is 1:39 am and watch the popes exorcist,wish me luck

**Day4: May 28, Sunday
**Today's Progress:Built a registration form using html and css.Writing the code now is becoming off the head activity 

**Day 5:June 7,wednesday
Its been more than a week since i updated the log problem being i got the survey certification part in freecodecamp and being the first task which i dont get short tasks i was quite stuck but i finally completed the tasks today and i hope i dont ever do that again.ps coding is hard and difficult but i promise i'll make it easy for me

For the past days ive been absent from the 100 day code challenge and as i result i see to muyself that i'll have to start again so from today tuesday,27 june 2023 i start again from dAY 1.

### Day 1: June 27, Tuesday
*** Already started freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification and i;m already on the second curriculum which introduces the rothko painting, i flowed with the codes today and i didnt find any difficulties with it but css as a whole looks more of a design thing which already isðŸ˜‚ AND ME BEING ME DON'T HAVE EYES FOR DESIGN BUT I'LL STILL GO THROUGH IT.

### Day 2: June 28, Wednesday
*** completed the css flexbox on freecodecamp and also started with the resources on the odins project

###Day 3: June 29,Thursday
*** Finished another task on freeCodCamp(Learn typography by building a nutrition label), I started coding around 11pm on thursday and actually ended up completing on friday also i have decided to start working on my own projects based on tasks i have already completed o n freeCodeCamps 

###Day 4: July 1, Saturday
*** Friday wasn't logged imn because i didnt have internet the whole day and because i uploaded the code on early friday dawn,so with today i learnt from the odinproject resource about the web and how it works, even though the challenge is a 100 days of code i didnt code anything today i just learnt some new things 

###Day 5: July 2, Sunday
***Today was a continuation on The Odin Projects prerequisite path,started learning about computer basics all the way to command line interface and git,setted up git on my terminal etc. but learning about cli today was a whole lot fun.No code today too

###Day 6: July 3, Monday
*** Learn accessibility by building quiz on freeCodeCamp,today was stressing and frustrating but i ended up using almost 4 hours on the task started around 9pm on monday and finished on 1am tuesday,im now going to read charts too,luckily today i wrote some codes and i'll be uploading to github.

For the past days i failed to follow the 100daysofcode challenge due to the fact that internet connectivity wasnt available at the time

###Day 7:July 11,2023, Tuesday
***I resumed my work on Havard's CS50 course on mario more comfortable pset1,when it comes to cs50 the tasks are more  hallenging than freecodecamp's task because with cs50 you're supposed to do research on your own. 

###Day 8:July 13,2023,Thursday
***Finally completed my mario-more pset on cs50,today is one of the days i feel proud about myself writing a code,this code has been bothering me for more than 12 weeks and finally today with determination and hardwork i was able to write the code for the pset

###Day 9: July 14,2023,Friday
*** Started the next c pset(cash less comfortable),I could not finish on the first day but i hope tomorrow,i'll get it,today was more about working the algorithm behind the code 

###Day 10: July 15,2023,Saturday
*** Completed the problem i started yesterday and moving to the next problem,even though this was a less comfortable one it was so hard on me considering i had to watch videos before i could understand what was required of me also i grasped a lil understanding beteen if else statements and while loops.

###Day 11: July 17,2023,Monday
***Started basic javascript today on leetcode and youtube
 
###Day 12: July 18,2023, Tuesday
***Remember i said i started leasrning js and i'll start bui;lding projects today,well thing is im over working myself so hence i've decided to stick to cs50 and feeCodeCamp's curriculum and also leetcode 30 days js.

###Day 13: August 4,2023 Friday
*** I know i havent been following up with the rules of the game and that is because i have been pursuing other fields in the game like ethical hacking also i remember last time i logged i talked about js projects it didnt turn out good for me so im back to the old grind

###Day 14: August 8,2023 Tuesday
*** i know it may seem like i'm not following the rules of the challenge but truth is everyday i make sure to follow freeCodeCamps's curriculum, i only write here whenver i finish a program and uploading to github,so there may be spaces in the dates but i know im doing it right.Todays freeCodeCamp was Learning Css Intermedia by building a picasso painting.

###Day 15: August 9,2023 Wednesday
***Todays project was just a 33 step process,its about Responsive web design by building a piano, This one took me only an hour
